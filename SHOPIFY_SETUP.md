# Shopify Theme Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ Important: How to View Your Homepage

If you're seeing a 404 page in the Shopify editor:

1. **Look at the left sidebar** - you should see "Home page" at the top
2. **Click on "Home page"** (not "404 page")
3. Your homepage with all sections should appear

## Current Status

✅ All theme files are in the correct location (repository root)
✅ All sections are created and configured
✅ Default content is set up in `templates/index.json`
✅ Header and Footer sections are included in the layout

## Sections Available

Your theme includes these sections (all customizable):

1. **Hero Section** - Full-screen hero with video/image background
2. **Product Collection** - Display products in a grid
3. **Trust Badges** - 4 trust indicators
4. **Newsletter** - Two-column newsletter signup
5. **Artist Feature** - Two-column artist showcase
6. **CTA Section** - Call-to-action with buttons
7. **Header** - Navigation and logo
8. **Footer** - Links, newsletter, social media

## Next Steps

1. **In Shopify Editor:**
   - Click "Home page" in the left sidebar (not 404 page)
   - You should see all sections listed
   - Click each section to customize it

2. **Add Your Content:**
   - Upload your logo in Header settings
   - Add a collection in Product Collection settings
   - Upload images for Hero, Newsletter, and Artist sections
   - Set up your navigation menu

3. **Customize:**
   - All sections have extensive customization options
   - Colors, text, images, spacing - everything is customizable
   - Changes save automatically

## If Sections Don't Appear

If you don't see sections in the editor:

1. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. Make sure you're on "Home page" not "404 page"
3. Check that the theme is published or in draft mode
4. Try clicking "Add section" button if available

## Troubleshooting

- **404 Error**: Make sure you're viewing "Home page" not "404 page"
- **Blank Sections**: Sections need content - add images, text, or select collections
- **No Products**: Create a collection and select it in Product Collection settings
- **Missing Header/Footer**: They should appear automatically - check layout/theme.liquid
